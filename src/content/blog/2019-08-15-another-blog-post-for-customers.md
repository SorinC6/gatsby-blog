The idea of survival permeates American culture, even as we veer farther away from it in our daily lives.  When hurricane season comes around, we can hear it in the voices of those who decided to stay behind.  I just know how to survive...we’re survivors out here in this part of the country...whatever nature decides to give us, we’ll take it on.



Sometimes, backpacking is presented as a form of survival.  You go out into the wilderness for a few days and survive the elements.  I’m sitting on a jumble of boulders at the crest of Park Ridge with my two hiking mates, Tim and Eric, looking out at the 10,500 foot Mount Jefferson, and the lush Jefferson Park wilderness at its base. While eating my lunch, I realize that I feel something that I consider to be the exact opposite of survival.



I have no dishes to do, nowhere to be, no texts to read, no responsibilities. For a short weekend, my life is on my back, and this sort of carefree feeling comes over me, maybe similar to waking up as a child on a midsummer day and having nothing to do.

Backpackers talk about the central challenge of keeping pack weight to a minimum.  Now, I feel the end result of that. With a light pack, I have food, water and shelter covered; I am a mobile, self-contained version of myself.  That feeling, again, is not one of survival, but simple carefree freedom.



## What  mean to you

Edith’s Checkerspots, black, red, yellow, orange and white butterflies, are abundant.  I often think of this butterfly as the Pacific Northwest’s most beautiful, especially when its wings are folded up and a bold cubist mosaic is revealed.



The Edith’s Checkerspot has been in sharp decline at the southern and northern edges of its range.  In Baja California, it has become locally extinct in low elevations, and in British Columbia, it has disappeared from the high elevations. It’s decline and local extinctions are explained by shorter seasons of favorable conditions in a warming climate.



As we descend, we pass several thru-hikers.  We are on the Pacific Crest Trail after all. When I stop to talk to one of them, I can’t help to notice his pack, which is half the size of mine, and his shoes, which are just sandals, and his water bottle, which is just a regular old water bottle.



He tells me he has been walking for thirty days.  He started in Northern California and had seen good weather the entire trip up.  He had been thinking all day about making it to Olallie Lake, where, he says, he might enjoy a beer.



“Honestly,” he explains, “a lot of thru-hikers get these cravings.  I don’t. I just eat whatever crap I can get.”



In his early sixties, this thru-hiker is on his second year of the Pacific Crest Trail.  Next year, he will make it to the Canadian border in Washington. He is the eighteenth thru-hiker we’ve passed today, suggesting the popularity of the long walk.



You can tell the thru-hikers right away.  Their packs are small, and they seem light on their feet.  Again, this reminds me that being in this alpine wilderness isn’t about survival, but being carefree
