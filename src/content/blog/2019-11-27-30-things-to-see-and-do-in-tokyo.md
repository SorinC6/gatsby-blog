**_1. Visit the Fish Market_**

The Tsukiji Fish Market was one of the most iconic staples of the city. In 2018, the market moved to Toyosu and is now twice the size of the original Tsukiji market. In fact, the new market is the largest fish market in the entire world. While you’ll need a visitor’s pass to enter (you can get one on arrival) the pass is free (which means you’ll have more money to spend on sushi!)



There are over 600 vendors here selling fresh fish as well as fresh fruits and vegetables. Gorge on sushi and marvel at the chaotic atmosphere of the world’s largest tuna market. The tuna auction here powers much of the world’s sushi supply, and it is truly a sight to be seen. You can also see a model of the largest tuna ever sold at Tsujiki — which weighed 500kg (1,100lbs!).



In addition to the new market, the old outer market at Tsukiji still has plenty of restaurants and shops. You can still head there to eat and look around, though all the action is now at Toyosu. Be sure to arrive early to beat the crowds (especially on Saturdays).



Tsukiji Fish Market: 5 Chome-2-1 Tsukiji, Chuo, +81 3-3542-1111. Admission is free. Toyosu Fish Market: 6 Chome-6-2 Toyosu, Koto, +81 3-3520-8205. Open Monday-Saturday from 5am-5pm, though most shops don’t open until 7am. Admission is free.

## 2. Explore by the Imperial Palace

The Imperial Palace is the official home of the Emperor of Japan. It’s a terrific spot to learn about Japan’s history and culture. Formerly Edo Castle, the palace was built in the 15th century, and some of the walls and moats from that time are still in use to this day. When the Emperor moved from Kyoto to Tokyo in 1869, he took Edo for his new palace and renamed it the Imperial Palace.
