# Malheur is completely empty.

But today, nobody appears to be here at all.   Judging by the maps, I expect to see a lake to the north of me.  But where Malheur Lake is supposed to be, I see only a dry basin, swirling dust.



As I head west towards Narrows, Oregon, that swirling dust begins to transform into something much larger, much more ominous.  It’s a dust storm, rising up from dried-out Mud Lake in a gale of dry wind.  



Normally, this time of year, the lakes fill up with seasonal rainwater.  The village of Narrows becomes just that: a narrow space tucked between two large bodies of water.  But for three years, there’s been little snow in the mountains, and record-breaking warm temperatures have melted the snowpack far too early.  No water is visible from Narrows. And while this year’s drought is considered a moderate one, it’s the compounding factor of three long years with little snowpack.



## From Narrows,

 I continue to head west onto South Harney Road.  By now, the dust storm has a violent quality to it; sand pings against the Jeep and visibility drops to meters.  



_As I head west beyond the handful of small ranch homes and yards of ranch equipment parts, the road turns to dried mud.  I can see that the last trucks to visit this road had huge tires, and had struggled through thick mud.  Now, the mud is all dried up, freezing the tire tracks into foot-tall driving obstacles._

Something about the juxtaposition of bringing up the birds and the irrigated fields south of Burns made the men want to talk about the occupation.  While I sip my coffee, one of them says to the others, “Last week was the bird festival.  More people came than ever before.”



Another says, “They wanted to see what the fuss was all about.”



“Apparently it was the biggest tourism weekend in Burns history.”



After a few minutes of everybody sharing opinions, one of the men says, “You know why Malheur is owned by the federal government in the first place?”



“Teddy Roosevelt wanted to protect egrets from plume hunters,” I reply, pleased with having done my homework.



“Sure, that’s true.  But that’s not the whole story.   In Roosevelt’s time, Malheur was just the lake.  But after that, ranchers were irrigating and squatting all over the place.  They used up all the water.  They basically killed the whole place.  Malheur was like a dust bowl.  We pretty much know this fact in Harney County, but those men who stormed the refuge, they weren’t from here.  They were from Arizona and Nevada.  They had no idea what they were fighting against.”



> Later, he says, “We have our beefs with the Bureau of Land Management, we have our beefs with the federal government.  We have our beefs with environmentalists.  But that’s how it’s supposed to be.  The fact is, there are jobs in Burns and there is water in Malheur because we learned how to collaborate with the government.  Without the refuge system, everybody was just suing everybody over their right to water that didn’t even exist anymore.”



_I say goodbye to the men at the gas station, surprised by their forthrightness and outright giddiness over the subject of the occupation.  I have been following the story of the Bundy family, who have been at the center of several protests over rancher’s rights since the nineties.  In my view, the story of the Bundys has mirrored a growing hatred for conservation politics that has risen to an almost religious fervor among right-wing blogs and cable news networks, where it has swivelled into such a strange place that there is now a movement that wants to do away with all public parks in the country._
