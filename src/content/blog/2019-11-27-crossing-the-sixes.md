But only one thirty-mile section, from Bandon to Port Orford in Oregon’s southern half, is tucked away and isolated from coastal highways.  To travel this beach route, traversed by only a few hundred people a year, is a rare experience in isolation and Pacific coast wilderness.

It’s a gray, still morning on the southern Oregon coast, and Brian and I are up early to hit the trail while the tide is still low. We plan to walk the route north to south, which keeps the strong afternoon coastal winds at our back. In high school, Brian and I worked together as founders of an outdoor adventures club. We grew up and pursued outdoor travel in our own ways. Today, I’m taking the first steps south with my friend of twenty-seven years.

The coastline at Bandon is complex with coastal rocks and sea stacks, broad, flat sand, vacation homes on bluffs. But as we head south, all of this quickly gives way to a vast and simple landscape of ocean, sand and sky.

* Brian envisioned the outdoors club as a very certain thing.  He wanted it to be called the Patagonia Club.  When he asked me to design the club t-shirt, he painted an image for me: It’s two guys on an elephant, which is hauling kayaks through a Savannah.
* Brian organized everything, and the types of outdoor adventures he put together were like this: teaching kids how to roll kayaks at the school swimming pool.  Rock climbing on Minnesota’s granite cliffs.  Spelunking in midwestern caverns. Trail biking in Wisconsin.  Early spring canoeing in the Boundary Waters.
* I was just along for the ride, but when I came to school one morning and saw ropes tied to a tree on one side of the school and draped over the roof of the school, I wondered how Brian was able to get away with this one.  “Brian, there are freshmen belaying off off the roof of the school!”
