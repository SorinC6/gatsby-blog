Costa Rica is a nature-lover’s paradise — and it’s one of my favorite countries in the world too. It was the first country I ever traveled to and it was the country that sparked my wanderlust.

The beaches feel like paradise, there’s great surfing, diving, and plenty of places to get away from the hordes of retired Americans that live here. No matter what your interest, there are tons of things to see and do in Costa Rica without breaking the bank.

## But is Costa Rica safe to visit?

The country was fortunate to escape the Cold War conflicts and brutal gang violence that impacted other countries in Central America. However, in recent years, Costa Rica has become more involved in drug trafficking and money laundering.
